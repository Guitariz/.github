### 🎼 Our Mission
At **Guitariz**, we believe that professional-grade music tools should be accessible to everyone. We are building an ecosystem that bridges the gap between **Artificial Intelligence** and **Creative Practice**, providing musicians with the precise tools they need to learn, analyze, and master their craft.

---

### 🚀 The Ecosystem
The Guitariz project encompasses a suite of high-performance tools designed for the modern musician:

*   **🧠 Audio Intelligence**: Real-time chord recognition powered by HMM logic and industry-standard source separation using state-of-the-art **Meta Demucs** models.
*   **🖥️ Digital Workbench**: A low-latency sandbox featuring an advanced 24-fret guitar engine, precision chromatic tuners, and interactive scale explorers.
*   **🕹️ Interactive Pedagogy**: Gamified ear training modules designed to master intervals, chord identification, and perfect pitch through an arcade-style experience.

### 🛠️ Hardware & Software Stack
We leverage a hybrid architecture to balance interactive frontend performance with high-compute AI microservices:
